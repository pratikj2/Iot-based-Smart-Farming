# Iot-based-Smart-Farming

Smart irrigation leverages IoT to provide precise, real-time water management for crops, ensuring sustainable and efficient farming. By integrating sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and motion with the Atmega328P microcontroller, the system monitors and controls irrigation through the Blynk app. This approach minimizes water wastage, optimizes crop yields, and promotes environmental sustainability. IoT enables data-driven insights for informed decisions, while predictive analytics forecasts water needs based on weather and soil conditions. Scalable and adaptable, this system enhances productivity and resilience across diverse agricultural settings.
